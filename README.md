TASK1:
MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON
A model that predicts the rating of a movie based on
features like genre, director, and actors. You can use regression
techniques to tackle this problem.
The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model
that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or
critics.   
TASK2:
SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON
Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that
customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as
advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and
advertising platform selection.
TASK3:
CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
A model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.
Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class
imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random
forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall,
and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or
undersampling for improving results.
